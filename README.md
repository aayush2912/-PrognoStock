# PrognoStock

The PrognoStock project aims to develop a robust stock forecasting model by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The initial step involved sourcing data from Yahoo Finance. Although the official API provided by Yahoo was discontinued in 2017, alternative methods were explored. The yfinance API was chosen due to its reliability and ease of use. The raw data obtained was in JSON format and covered a wide range of financial instruments. It was then transformed into a combined clean dataframe for further analysis.

Time Series Analysis (TSA) was employed to model the sequential patterns in historical stock price data. he data was grouped by sector to analyze sector-specific trends. Data normalization was performed to remove outliers and avoid issues like oversampling and undersampling. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with two layers of 50 units each was trained. The model was trained on 5 epochs with a batch size of 32. Post-training, residuals were calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

Several machine learning models were implemented, with a focus on the Gradient Boosting Predictor due to its superior performance with selected hyperparameters - Loss, Learning Rate, n_estimators, max_depth and random_State. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and residuals were calculated to verify the model's accuracy and precision.The PrognoStock project aims to develop a robust stock forecasting model by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
