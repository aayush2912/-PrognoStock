Describe your contributions below.

* * *

### Visualization 1: Sector Performance Over Time

Type: Line Chart
Data: Closing price or a price index for each sector over a specific timeframe.
Insights: Identify trends in sector performance, compare relative movements across sectors.
Customization: Use different line colors for each sector. Highlight specific periods of strong performance/decline for a particular sector with thicker lines or annotations.

### Visualization 2: Distribution of P/E Ratios by Sector
Type: Box Plot
Data: P/E ratios for companies within each sector.
Insights: Understand the distribution of valuations within each sector, identify potential outliers (potentially undervalued/overvalued companies).
Customization: Color-code boxes based on sector. Annotations for sector medians and outliers can be added for emphasis.

### Visualization 3: Sector Correlation Matrix (Optional - for many sectors)
Type: Heatmap
Data: Correlation coefficients between closing prices of different sectors.
Insights: Reveal potential dependencies between sectors. Sectors with high positive correlation might move in tandem, while negative correlations suggest potentially counterbalancing movements.
Customization: Use a color gradient to represent correlation strength (red for negative, blue for positive). Focus on the upper triangle of the matrix to avoid redundancy.

### Visualization 4: Company Performance within a Sector (Drill-Down)
Type: Scatter Plot (interactive, if possible)
Data: Stock price or a performance metric (e.g., % change) vs. another metric (e.g., market capitalization) for companies within a chosen sector.
Insights: Identify high/low performers within a sector based on the chosen metrics.
Customization: Allow interactivity to highlight specific companies on hover. Color points based on company size or other relevant factors.
