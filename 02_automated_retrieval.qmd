- The yahoo finance API has a wide range of data like Cryptocurrencies, regular currencies, stocks and bonds, fundamental and options data, and market analysis and news.

- We intented to use the official API provided by Yahoo, but seems like this was shutdown in 2017. 

- The next option was to scrape the data from their website or to use pre exisitng APIS

- We explored two popular APIS in python - RapidAPI, yahoo_finance and yfinance 

- We decide to go forward with yfinance API
